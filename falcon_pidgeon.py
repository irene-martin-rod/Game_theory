print ("Dileme proposed by John Maynard Smith. This dileme try to explain how individuals within a population behave when they compete by resources and which conduct is the most estable evolutionary strategy or which is the most stable prportion. Falcon individuals are aggressive whereas pidgeons always dialogue. Falcons fight to obtain the resource, although this can cause some damage. Pidgeons try to persude to obtain the resource and if they don't win, they retire and only lose time.\n Therefore, the game have these variables:\n- P: benefit of wining the prey (resource)\n- H: the cost of being damage\n- T: losed time in an argument without fight.\n\nIn this case, we are going to consider these rules are:\n- P > H\n- P > T\n- H > T\n- Falcon vs. falcon: there will we a fight. The winner obtain the prey without damage (P), but the loser will suffer harm (-H).\n\nTherefore, the average benefit per\n- Falcon is (P-H)/2\n- Falcon vs. pidgeon: the falcon obtains the prey (P), and the pidgeon doesn't have or benefit or loses (0)|n- Pidgeon vs. pidgeon: they try to dialogue. The winner obtains the prey but aldo he has lost time (P-T). The looser has lost time (-T). The average benefit per pidgeon is (P-2T)/2)")
